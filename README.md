Steps on how to create GitHub Page:
1. Open your repository and go to its setting
2. In the settings, you would be able to see the pages section and make sure to change the branch where your files are located.
3. Save it and wait for a couple of minutes since it would take time before it is published.

What are your takeaways from this exercise?
  I realized that there was a vast amount of tools that you can utilize in order to further enhance the appearance of your website.
It would take some trials and errors before you get your desired output but from those experiences, I was able to learn more about
the usage of other tools that I haven't use before.
